                  <br>
                  <p>
                    Canada occupies the most northern stretch of North America. It is the world’s second-largest
                     country by area and extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean.
                     Canada shares land borders with the United States to the northwest and south.</p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                        A habitat of aboriginal people, Canada was founded in 1867 as a union of British North
                         American colonies. It gained independence from the United Kingdom in an incremental process that ended in 1982.
                         It remains a Commonwealth Realm with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state.</p>
                          <br>
                          <p>
                            Canada is a federal constitutional monarchy with parliamentary democracy. Comprising
                             of ten provinces and three territories, Canada is a bilingual and multicultural country,
                              with both English and French as official languages. A technologically advanced and
                               industrialized nation, Canada maintains a diversified economy that is heavily reliant 
                               upon its abundant natural resources and trade – particularly
                             with the United States, with which Canada has had a long and complex relationship. </p>

                              <h4><b>Government</b></h4>  
                         <p>
                            The government in Canada has similarities with the British system and at
                             present, it operates as a federal multiparty constitutional monarchy. When 
                             it comes to the matter of provincial law, local government can operate with 
                             their own ability to legislate on provincial matters. The head of state is Queen
                              Elizabeth II with a governor-general appointed as a commonwealth representative in
                             Canada. Ottawa is home to Canada’s parliament, House of Commons and Senate. </p>
